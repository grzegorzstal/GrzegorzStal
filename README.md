# Hello there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="60px" height="60px" />

I'm **Grzegorz Stal** (but do call me **Greg!**), a recent 1st class Business Management and Economics graduate from the University of Sheffield.

This page is a brief collection of my projects and personal learning journey as I develop my technical skillset. At the moment, I'm particularly fascinated with AI, cloud technologies, data science, machine learning, and automation.

I genuinely enjoy the challenges involving the intersection of business strategy and technical solutions. My future goal is to help organisations navigate their digital transformation by bridging these two worlds together.

Please do feel free to explore my work and connect if anything resonates!
